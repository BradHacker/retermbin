# ReTermbin

> NOTE: This project is for educational purposes only!!! I am not responsible for the misuse of this code

Just a dumb little app to scrape Termbin for some spicy data üî•

Uses Go coroutines to run multiple concurrent requests at once for lightning fast mining ‚ö°Ô∏è

Configure the amount of concurrent workers you want running by modifying the `MAX_CONCURRENT_WORKERS` value ‚õè

Have fun!!!
